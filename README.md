## Things to Change
1. The syntax of the language
1. Having more readability in the code and comments 

1. Remove native script and visual script
1. Simplify the documentation

## The Language
Like in the _"Things to change"_. The syntax would be changed, but mostly just different word choices. 

func turns to function and the start of a code block would be {} not :

Thing would be shorted like Vector3() to Vec3()

And finally the 3d translate, "transform," is now translate
